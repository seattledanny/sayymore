Unlike the name of this subreddit the poster does not have to be a literal devil with horns to fit here. We let posts stay up here often depending on the top comments of the original post: if they agree that the poster is an asshole. If they don’t: please crosspost it to somewhere else, for example r/AmITheAngel. \n\nWe ask you to please read and follow the rules. Here’s an overview:\n\n* Don’t brigade: don’t comment on the original post. Don’t upvote/downvote the original post. Don’t go after the original poster in DMs or in previous posts of theirs. We have a no tolerance policy for this rule. \n\n* Stay on topic: this subreddit is for discussing the crosspost and the poster. Stick to that topic, please.\n\n* Don’t repost: please check the subreddit before crossposting to ensure you’re not reposting.\n\n* Civility: try to remain civil in the comments. We understand that discussions can get heated. You won’t be permanently banned for this unless you’re repeatedly being uncivil.\n\n* No shitposts: this is only a place for crossposts. Don’t make up fake posts. Don’t ask here if you’re an asshole/devil. Go to r/AmItheAsshole etc. for that. \n\nHope you have a good time here!",
